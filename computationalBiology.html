                I am currently developing a bioinformatics app to innovate the field with my coding expertise. I have developed Python applications such as a DNAGenre in progress and developed quite some python scripts to automate tasks like give analysis on a DNA strand in both Python and C++<br><br>Below are the achievements.

        <p>
            This is a bioinformatics app that I am currently developing to innovate the field with my coding expertise. The app will analyze DNA strands and provide insights into the genetic code of organisms. The app will be developed in Python and C++ to enhance performance and accuracy.

            This is a simple console-based program that analyzes DNA strands in C++. The program reads a DNA strand and provides insights into the genetic code of organisms. The program is used to demonstrate the syntax and structure of a C++ program.
