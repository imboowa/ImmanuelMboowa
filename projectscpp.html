                I have built efficient console-based programs in C++, including a Snake game and a letter roller program. C++ enhances performance, and I apply it in computational biology for faster computations.<br><br>Below are the projects.

            This is a simple console-based program that prints information that shows you purchased a car a while back. The program is a basic introduction to C++ programming and is used to demonstrate the syntax and structure of a C++ program.

        <p class='paragraphs'>  
            This is a simple console-based nearly Snake game developed in C++. The game is played by the computer moving letter 'o' around the screen to eat food. The game ends when the snake runs into letter 'T'.

        <p class='paragraphs'>
            This is a simple console-based program that rolls letters in a string. The program takes a string randomly chosen by the computer and it displays them in a loop design in the Terminal.

        <p class='paragraphs'>
            This is a simple console-based program that encrypts and decrypts messages using a random computer cipher. The cipher is random so when a letter is picked in a string to be encrypted, it index is chosen and used in the random cipher to replace the letter with the random cipher letter.
